Summary
On this program the student will be able to build programs that help him in real world enviroment and be prepared to take more advanced programming courses.
In course 1 the basic concepts of programming are worked on using the Python programming language to build small programs.
In course 2 covers data structures built into Python, working with files, and handling exceptions, in order to make programs that work with a lot of data taken from computer files.
The third course encompasses the concepts of the object-oriented programming paradigm. The purposes of the course are to design and build systems with objects to 
model whatever aspect of reality you want.
course 4, instead of working with simple files, we work with relational databases that allow us to save information with a certain structure and retrieve the data efficiently.
This allows you to work with large volumes of data.
